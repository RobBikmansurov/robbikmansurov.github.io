I enjoy playing basketball and running, I'm a CIO in an average universal bank, I'm software developer (RubyOnRails, VB, Python). I like to create information systems and programs and try something new.

I have reached the limit in the current organization and I want to reload my career. I want to progress, mastering the most modern technologies.
Now I'm looking for remote work (but relocation is also possible) in a cool team in a complex project with advanced processes to the position of senior backend developer Ruby.

## Last my projects as a developer:

### Internal http-service for generation PDF from payment document

### API-backend for personal cabinets of our clients on bank`s site

API-backend for the personal cabinets of bank customers [Ruby on Rails, Nginx, PostgreSQL, JWT], react-frontend is developing by other team.

### [BP1Step](/bp1step) - Business Processes First Step

My first Ruby On Rails project is used by our organization [Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, GitlabCI/CD].

Identification and documentation of business processes, storage of executor`s actions, the description of resources. This is the 1st step of implementation of the process approach in small business, improve document management and office work

You should try [this demo](http://bp1step.herokuapp.com/about){: target="_blank"} on Heroku, sorry for the slow awakening.
This is an open source project and it hosts on GitHub - [BP1Step](https://github.com/RobBikmansurov/bp1step).

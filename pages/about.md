I enjoy playing basketball and running. I'm the CIO of an average universal bank. I'm a software developer (RubyOnRails, VB, Python). I like creating information systems and programs and trying new things.

I have reached the limit in my current organization, and I want to change my career path. I want to progress, mastering the most modern technologies.
Now, I'm looking for remote work (but relocation is also possible) in a cool team. I'd like to work on complex projects with advanced processes as a senior backend Ruby developer.

## My last projects as a developer:

### Internal http-service that generates PDF's out of payment documents.

It uses the odf-report to convert template to PDF and tiny_tds to get documents from MS SQL.

### API-backend for personal cabinets of our clients on the bank`s site.

API-backend for the personal cabinets of bank customers [Ruby on Rails, Nginx, PostgreSQL, JWT], react-frontend was developing by another team.
Internal web-application for customer management in their personal cabinets.

### [BP1Step](/bp1step) - Business Processes First Step

<img src="/images/bp1step-to-execution.png" alt="BP1Step lists task, letters to execute" class="about-photo" style="width: 150px;"/>

My first Ruby On Rails project has been using in the our organization for many years [Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, GitlabCI/CD].

Identification and documentation of business processes, storage of executor`s actions, the description of resources. This is the 1st step of implementation of the process approach in a small business: improve document management and office work.

You can try [this demo](http://bp1step.herokuapp.com/about){: target="_blank"} out on Heroku (sorry for the slow loading time).

[BP1Step](https://github.com/RobBikmansurov/bp1step) is an open source project, and it's available on [GitHub](https://github.com/RobBikmansurov/bp1step).

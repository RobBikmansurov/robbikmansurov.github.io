I enjoy playing basketball and running, I'm a CIO in an average universal bank, I'm software developer (RubyOnRails, Python, VB). I like to create information systems and programs and try something new

I have reached the limit in the current organization and I want to reload my career. I want to progress, mastering the most modern technologies.
Now I'm looking for remote work (but relocation is also possible) in a cool team in a complex project with advanced processes to the position of senior backend developer Ruby.
